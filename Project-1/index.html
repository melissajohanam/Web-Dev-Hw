    <hr>
    <p> Yeah, you can be the greatest, you can be the best
You can be the king kong banging on your chest
You can beat the world, you can win the war
You can talk to God, go banging on his door

You can throw your hands up, you can beat the clock
You can move a mountain, you can break rocks
You can be a master, don't wait for luck
Dedicate yourself and you gon' find yourself</p>
