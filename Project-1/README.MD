<h2> the browser I use to surf for the web was Google Chrome. A browser functions by using protocol that is named as HTTP protocol. It sends the request of the text document encoded to the web server and then receives the response from that server and passes it on. This text document consists of the special markup code known as HTML(HyperText Markup language)and is used for most of the websites.</h2>

<h3> The Wayback Machine was an awesome experience I didn't even realize that site existed. It was cool to literally go back in time to see how many people have used a specific website and what they were searching at the time.</h3>

<h4> where did you go?</h4>
* In the Wayback Machine I searched yahoo.com, from there I picked December 12 1998.

<h5> what did it look like?</h5>
* To me it looked really simple, basic, different from year 2018. Not many people searched anything in 1998.

<h6> how has it changed?</h6>
* The main page of Yahoo was basic and simple to use. It didn't have advertisment's on the main page like it does now.

<h7> Work cycle this week.</h7>
* In this work cycle I learned how to create our own project 1 by learning how to go live on the web, we learned about browsers and the history
* I learned how to create our own html site and how to add stuff inside. How to add different types of elements, tags, put headings to our webpage, paragraphs, empty elements like, line breaks, horizontal rules, and adding images to the webpage.</h7>

<h8> Did you have any problems and issues? How did you solve these?
This week I didn't have any problems or issues that I can remember. If I did, to solve the problems or issues I would go back and read Topic 3 until I find what i need.</h8>
