# Intro-web-dev Homework Depo
## Melissa Maldonado
  I have decided to take this class because I would like to learn to be able to create websites so one day I can be able to have my own business. In this business I will be wanting to create web sites for people's businesses. I'm very eager to learn from this class because I believe that I can be able to be better than the competition. I'm looking forward to challenge my creative skills in this class and career.  
* I have learn that the internet is a place where people can connect with each other globally.
* The internet is Decentralized.
* It was interesting that no one really knows what really is the internet, and also no one really knows who controls the internet.
