  what is a version control system and why are we using it in this course?

  A version control system allows to make changes to a file and set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. We are using it in the course so that we can make easy pushing changes to Github and allowing others to view what we have done in our assignments.

  work cycle made this week

  This week we learned how to create many files within folders to put in our github website using atom. I didn't really make any individual choices in this cycle  

  Did you have any problems or issues? how did you solve these?

  I had a couple problems and issues during some part of the homework, but I was able to resolve them by just repeating and retracing my steps until I got it right. It was a little stressful but I was able to do it.

is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?

for this section everything was really clear to me so no need to discuss anything further.

Did you post any of your problems to issues to the repo? what issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?

no I didn't post any problems to issues to the repo because I was able to resolve it by myself. I didn't help any of my fellow classmates with the past homework cycle cause I haven't seen discussions of help being needed.
