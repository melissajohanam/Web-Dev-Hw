A head element, is a container for processing information and document, it contains high level information about the site and will always comes first within the root element. contains the thoughts of the page. The body element is where all of the <i> meats and potatoes</i> of the site gets placed. Where the data is displaced on the client's local computer.-
- The difference between the structural and semantic markup is that the structural markup embodies information about the structure of a document and the semantic markup reinforces the information of the document. it can be use to place a emphasis on a word or phrase, or identify a word as being strong. they provide citations, quotations, link to definitions, or distinguish editorial changes.-
- In this assignment, I learned more about html documents. how to put head elements, do structural markup and semantic markup, and the use of internal and external hyperlinks. This week I actually to be honest skimmed through the assignment because I have been busy taking care of my son in NICU. But was still able to do the assignment. I didn't have any difficulties doing the assignment this week. it was pretty straight forward.-
